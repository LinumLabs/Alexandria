## Glossary
The deffinitions for the various different ERC/ECR/EIP's categories.
| Term | Definition |
|-----:|:-----------|
| DID  | *Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier for verifiable, "self-sovereign" digital identity.* |
| Registry | *A collection of information related to a specific topic, such as the ENS registry that maps human readable names to addresses* |
| Token Standard | *A technical standard used for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for implementing tokens that have specific functionality* |

|---------:|:----:|:-------:|:-------------:|:---------|
|**ERC725**| DID  | A _"Proxy contract for key management and execution, to establish a Blockchain identity." - `ERC725`_ The `ERC725` was made with a single focus, to manage identities. Its counterpart `ERC735` manages claims on those identities. The identity created by an `ERC725` can hold keys to sign actions and claims. The `ERC725` also has a proxy function to act directly on the blockchain. Claims can be attested from third parties, or self-attested (through `ERC735`).  | [#725](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/725) | [here]() |
|**ERC735**| (Claim) Registry | A _"Standard function for adding, removing and holding of claims. These claims can"_ (be) _"attested"_ (by) _"third parties (issuers) or self attested." - `ERC735`_. The `ERC735` standard deals with the management, creation, approval etc of claims.  | [#735](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/735) | [here]() |
|**ERC777**| Token standard | An improved version of the `ERC20` (and is backwards compatible), allowing for control over which token the contract / wallet accepts. `ERC777` also has a new function called operators, which allow for certain actions to happen on the transference of tokens. For example, a portion of transactions could be donated, or used to cover gas fees. These operators can be switched off by token holders. | [#777](https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/777) | [here]() |
|**ERC780**| (Claim) Registry |`ERC780` is a registry, _"which allows persons, smart contracts, and machines to issue claims about each other, as well as self issued claims." - `ERC780`_. This provides a flexible approach for claims that dose not distinguish between different addresses. A `claim` is non transferable. `ECR780` aims to provide a central point of reference for on-chain claims on Ethereum. | [#780](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/780) | [here]() |
|**ERC820**| Registry | The `ERC820` standard is a registry standard that allows for contracts and regular addresses to publish which functionalities they implement, directly or through a proxy. Any address can query the registry for information about a specific address implements an interface, and which smart contract handles its implementation.  | [#820](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-820) | [here]() |
|**ERC1056**| DID | `ERC1056` is an identity standard that allows an identity to have an unlimited number of `delegates`(addresses that can sign on your behalf) and `attributes`(data associated with ID) associated with it. | [#1056](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1056) | [here]() |
|**ERC1077**| DID | Allows users to sign messages to show intent, and allowing a third party to execute on that signed message. This aims to standardize this design pattern, giving dApp developers for flexibility and can help preventing users authorization fatigue (where users have to sign so many transactions they no longer read them). | [#1077](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1077.md) | [here]()|
|**ERC1078**| DID | This is for signingup/login design pattern more similare to patterns already in use. Login system using sub domains on ENS, users can reuse domain identities on apps provided they have the private keys to said domains via the uses of signed messages (1077). ERC1078 treates the private key like an access token allowing the user to register their username as an ENS subdomain of that dApp or use a .eth domain name as a user name. | [#1078](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1078.md) | [here]() |
|**ERC1155**| Token Standard | A standard interface for contracts so that contracts can manage multiple token types. A single deployed contract can store multiple tokens: fungible, non-fungible and other configurations. This has been created to prevent having to deploy a new contract for every new token when that may not be financially viable. | [#1155](https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/1155) | [here]()|
